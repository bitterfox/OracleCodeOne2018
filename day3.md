    - ZGC, Panama, Valhalla, etc

    - Readability of Java
  - Ultimate Performance
    - Java is faster than python
  - Density
  - Valhalla
    - better memory layout for value type
    - to enhance efficiency of those computation
  - massive data scaling
    - need terabytes or petabytes heap
    - ZGC

- Serialization
  - Why need serialization
    - to communcate with other JVM or bring data to other jVM
    - used everywhere around java platform
    - it's useful but, ...
  - serialized bytes format and the rules
    - ser ver id
    - can we change serialized bytes?
      - if the changed class is completally not sub type of it will be exception, but...
    - constructor is not called, but static initializer is called on deserialization
      - this is useful for evil guys
      - field is not initialized by constructor or something else
      - if parent class doesn't implements Serializable, then constructor for parent class is called
    - Java serialization is a great git to the bad guys
  - serialization vulnerabilities
    - a lot
    - over 20
    - lessons
      - able to opt-in deserialization and take more control, but...
      	- need to reduce exposure
	  - able to opt-out deserialization, but...
            - need to place boiler plate code on every classes
            - it's anoy due to private final signature
          - jdk expose
          - write own ObjectInputStream
	  - Modular
	  - other alternative data format like JSON, or etc
	    - stop native serialization
	    - but JSON also has vulnerabilities
	      - JSON cannot have type info
    - examples
      - Data manipulation
      	- Data DOS
	- can trigger OOM to give MA_INT to array length
    - Gadget Chains
      - Can call Runtime.exec() or something other bad API
      - it's difficult to find such change?

- Phaser, StampedLock, VarHandle
  - Phaser
    - Similar to CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier, but more flexible
  - StampedLock
    - not reentrant
    - faster way to ensure consistency and access across fields and classes which will be changed by other thread than synchronized, ReadWriteLock
    - VarHandle
      - replacement of Unsafe

- ZGC
  - What is it
    - Low latency new GC in JDK11
    - <= 10ms pause time
      - don't increase with the heap size or # of object
      - do increase with root set size
      	- num size
    - 15%
    - Concurrent, Tracing, Compacting, Single generation, Region based, NUMA aware, Load barriers, Colored pointer
  - Tuning
    - Give enough heap size due to concurrent GC
      - consider allocation rate and relocation speed
      	- See "Allocated" in log
    - ConcGCThreads
    - logging
      - Unified JVM Logging
    - Future plans
      - short
       	- Conc class unload
	- make it product feature
      - Long
      	- Generational
  - ?
    - how region is decided
      - region size is vary
      - small object goes smaller region, medium object goes medium region
    - what risks on production
      - class unloading is not implemented in JDK11
      - no big risks
    - fewer # of thread or # of thread stack will reduce pause time
      - yes
    - such kind of load barrer was expencive before, but it's now not expencive thanks by greate branch preditiction
    - What will it happen on write path
      - Nothing happen
    - What will happen if it's get 100% usage during GC cycle? STW? FullGC
      - No FullGC
      - Allocating thread will be stopped until garbage is collected, it'll be done in n00 ms
    - Can we configure to config when start GC cycle

      - Spike tolalent parameter
